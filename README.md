This project aims to build better graphics with the CSV files from pgcluu
(https://pgcluu.darold.net/).

To use it, you need to put the csv file in a directory called pgcluu_csv (or
change the variable named PCDIR). Then, execute the script called gp.sh. It will
create two directories:

  * gnuplot_csv, which contains CSV files better suited for gnuplot
  * gnuplot_png, which contains all the graphs in PNG format.

Some graph examples are available in the examples directory of the repository.
